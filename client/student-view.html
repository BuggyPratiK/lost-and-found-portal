      IMPORTANT CHANGE: We now link to two JavaScript files.
      1. api.js: This file handles all the communication with our backend server.
      2. script.js: This file contains the logic specifically for this page.
      
      'api.js' MUST be included before 'script.js' because script.js uses the
      functions that are defined in api.js. The 'defer' attribute ensures
      the scripts run after the HTML is parsed.

    <script src="script.js" defer></script>

<!-- 
  CHANGE 1: Added a unique ID to the body tag.
  Our new script.js file will check for this ID to know which page is currently active.
  This allows us to use one script file for multiple pages.

  CHANGE 2: Removed the onload="renderItems(...)" attribute.
  Our new script.js will handle all the logic for fetching and displaying items
  when the page loads, which is a much cleaner and more modern approach.
